# Data-Cleaning-SQL-Project-Global-Layoffs-Analysis

Overview : 
This repository contains a comprehensive SQL project focused on cleaning and preparing a dataset related to global layoffs. The project demonstrates various data cleaning techniques to transform raw data into a structured format suitable for analysis. Key operations include standardizing data, removing null and blank values, and eliminating unnecessary rows and columns. Advanced SQL features such as Common Table Expressions (CTEs), subqueries, and data type conversions are utilized extensively throughout the project.

Project Objectives
Standardize Data: Ensure consistency across the dataset by standardizing date formats, text case, and other attributes.
Remove Null/Blank Values: Identify and remove records with null or blank values to ensure data integrity.
Eliminate Redundant Data: Remove unnecessary rows and columns that do not contribute to the analysis.
Change Data Types: Convert data types as necessary to facilitate accurate calculations and queries.

Dataset
The dataset used in this project contains information about layoffs from various companies around the world. It includes details such as company, industry, number of employees laid off, date of layoff, and other relevant attributes.
